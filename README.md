# NAND
A short pygame demo (that will be expanded upon) that showcases the power of NAND in a graph theory inspired format.

## Instructions for use
Press `1` for "modify" mode. Click on a node to reverse its status.

Press `2` for "connection" mode. Click on a node to mark it for connection, and click another to connect the marked node to the clicked node.

Press `3` for "create" mode. Click anywhere to add another node.

Press `SPACE` to update the nodes. Later, automatic updating of the nodes per frame (or an equivalant time frame) will be added.

## Packages/Installation
Fairly simple- just run "main.py". As for packages:
- `numpy 2.3.2`
- `bezier 2024.6.20`
- `pygame 2.6.1`
